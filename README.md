My favorite package is the sf package, which can be found on CRAN or github. It has a LENGTHY vignette which details everything from what a simple feature is, different geometry types, how they are organized in R, and much more. 

Sunny Jardine probably has great applications of this package posted somewhere, but it is widely used and I am sure could be found on X, etc. 



#Review 
This package is mainy used for using spatial data and creating maps/other plots. It is achieves a lot of what is acheieved through point and click methods on GIS softwares. I like this package because it has a lot of different functions that are useful for many different data types. It is not always the most intuitive, and definitely should be learned using resources online and ideally a course. I absolutely recommend this package to anyone that wants to use data with spatial feautures and make cool graphics.
